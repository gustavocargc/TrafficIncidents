# Data Analysis with Python and SQL of Traffic Incidents
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of traffic incidents using the programming languages Python and SQL. Data analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and improving road safety, and this project aims to explore the information contained in traffic incident datasets to gain valuable insights.

## Tools Used
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Database: SQL

## Project Steps
Data Collection: Traffic incident data is obtained from reliable and relevant sources. The data quality is verified, and if necessary, cleaning and preprocessing steps are performed.

Data Manipulation and Analysis: Using the Pandas library, the data is manipulated and prepared for analysis. Cleaning, filtering, and transformation techniques are applied to obtain a consistent dataset suitable for analysis.

Data Visualization: With the help of Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, informative graphs and visualizations are created to aid in the understanding of traffic incidents. Data visualization facilitates the identification of patterns, trends, and relevant insights.

Data Analysis with SQL: Using the SQL language, queries and manipulations are performed on the data to extract specific information. These queries may include aggregations, table joins, and data filtering based on defined criteria.

Insights and Conclusions: Based on the data analysis, important insights about traffic incidents are identified. These conclusions may address areas of high incident rates, risk factors, critical time periods, and other aspects relevant to road safety.
